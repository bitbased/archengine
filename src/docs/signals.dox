/*! @page signals Signal handling

ArchEngine has no signal handlers and does not modify process signal handler behavior in any way.

ArchEngine restarts any system calls interrupted by a signal.

ArchEngine applications exiting as a result of a signal should exit ArchEngine gracefully, closing any open ArchEngine handles, before terminating the process.

ArchEngine is not re-entrant, and applications using ArchEngine should not make ArchEngine API calls from signal handlers.
