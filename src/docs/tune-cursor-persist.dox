/*! @page tune_cursor_persist Cursor persistence

Opening a new cursor is a relatively expensive operation in ArchEngine
(especially in table objects and Log-Structured Merge Trees (LSM) trees,
where a logical cursor may require multiple, underlying object cursors),
and caching cursors can improve performance. On the other hand, cursors
hold positions in objects, and therefore long-lived cursor positions can
decrease performance by blocking page eviction or looking like a
long-lived transaction.

Best practices are to cache cursors, but use the AE_CURSOR::reset method
to discard the cursor's position in the object when the position is no
longer needed.  Additionally, use the AE_CURSOR::insert method instead
of the AE_CURSOR::update method when there's no need to hold a position
in the object, because the AE_CURSOR::insert method never holds a cursor
position and there's no need to call AE_CURSOR::reset.
